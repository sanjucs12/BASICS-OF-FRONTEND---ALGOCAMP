      <h2>TRAVEL TIPS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This tip is for the foreign tourists visiting this city, carrying
          Indian Rupees (INR) is a must to transact in the city. But even if you
          didn’t convert before getting here, don’t panic. Bangalore has one of
          the highest foreign exchange service providers in the country.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are bound to experience good weather even in the summer months.
          While the average temperature in the summer months is around 30
          degrees Celsius, in winter the temperature may drop even below 20
          degrees Celsius. It receives rainfall from June to November,
          essentially leaving it with only two summer months. The climate here
          is one of the best that you will find in India.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the nights can get a little chilly, it is always advised to keep
          a windcheater or light sweatshirt to throw on if needed. Apart from
          keeping the weather in mind, Bangalore city does not really have a
          dress code, everybody is quite chilled out and you will find people
          roaming the streets in tees, jeans, and floaters.
        </li>
        <li>
          We advise that you carry a small bag for exploring the city and if you
          plan to travel in and around the city. If you check in to a hotel and
          leave your bags there, it is fine. However, since it is preferred to
          cover the city using the public mode of transportation, small luggage
          becomes more convenient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before visiting any city, it is best to know what kind of food you
          will expect here. While one cannot guarantee amazing butter chicken
          and dal makhani at every restaurant, you will get some lip-smacking
          local delicacies here apart from the amazing global cuisine.
        </li>
        <li>
          And last but not least, the traffic situation that bothers everyone –
          it is advisable to use public transport like buses rather than hiring
          a car or getting a cab – this may take forever to get you to your
          destination, especially during peak office hours.
