        Hi, I'm Sanju C S, a highly motivated and results-driven web developer
        with one year of professional experience. My expertise lies in building
        dynamic and responsive web applications using a robust tech stack that
        includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Express.js, Node.js,
        MySQL, and Sequelize. I am passionate about creating intuitive user
        interfaces and seamless user experiences while also excelling in
        back-end development to ensure data integrity and server-side
        functionality. My dedication to continuous learning and staying
        up-to-date with the latest industry trends allows me to deliver
        cutting-edge solutions to complex web development challenges. I am eager
        to expand my skills and knowledge to become a full-stack web developer
        and contribute to the success of innovative projects.
